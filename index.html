      I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://eda.mmci.uni-saarland.de/" target="_blank">Exploratory Data Analysis Group</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. I completed my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/" target="_blank">Saarland University, Germany</a>. Before that I did my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Pulchowk campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. I am primarily interested in Exploratory Data Mining. In particular, I develop methods for mining interesting patterns from data with the aid of Information Theory.

      I have greatly benefited from free courses & materials available online. Among many, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm" target="_blank">Introduction to Algorithms</a> (OCW MIT) was the one I enjoyed the most. I have been so touched by the last lecture of Randy Pausch: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo" target="_blank">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> & Walter Lewin: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRh75B5iotI" target="_blank">For the love of Physics</a>. You might find this 3 minute talk delivered by Derek Sivers in TED conference interesting: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en" target="_blank">How to start a movement</a>. If you have some free time to think about the progress of applied side of computer science, you might as well find <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191183-experiments-as-research-validation/fulltext" target="_blank">this discussion</a> interesting.
