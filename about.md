## News
🚀 We’re hiring CUDA Performance Engineers to accelerate AI inference at scale for Amazon Bedrock! If you’re passionate about optimizing GPU workloads, building high-performance distributed inference solutions and unlocking the efficiency of state-of-the-art foundation models, we should talk. Send your CV to kaibud [at] amazon [dot] com.

## Bio

I am currently a Team Lead (Sr. Applied Scientist) in the AWS Deep Science for Systems and Services team, where I work at the intersection of machine learning and systems. Our team’s goal is to optimize foundation models for inference in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)—driving higher hardware utilization, lower latency, and lower cost. We develop algorithms and optimize systems that power GenAI workloads in Amazon Bedrock without compromising model accuracy.

I joined [Amazon Research Lablet Tübingen](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazons-fourth-r-d-center-in-germany-is-dedicated-to-open-ai-research) (part of AWS AI) in 2020, where I developed algorithms / tools to help businesses explain complex cause-effect relationships underlying their business problems, and led cross-org effort within Amazon to launch them in production {% cite budhathoki:2022:rca-outliers-blog --file about %}{% cite budhathoki:2021:rca-dist-change-blog --file about %}{% cite goetz:2022:gcm-announcement-aws --file about %}.
<!-- Typical business problems involved effect estimation, and root cause analysis of changes / outliers. Some solutions are still actively used in production by -->
Businesses like Amazon Supply Chain and Amazon Ads actively use those solutions for effect estimation and root cause analysis of changes / outliers.
Those algorithmic solutions were also open-sourced to the Python [DoWhy](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy) library under a new package called [`gcm`](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.9.1/user_guide/gcm_based_inference/introduction.html) {% cite goetz:2022:gcm-announcement-aws --file about %}{% cite  bloebaum:2023:aws-rca-blog --file about %}{% cite kiciman:2022:gcm-announcement-msr --file about %}. This collaboration with Microsoft Research led to a new GitHub organization, [PyWhy](https://www.pywhy.org/), with the mission to build an open source ecosystem for causal machine learning {% cite goetz:2022:gcm-announcement-aws --file about %}{% cite kiciman:2022:gcm-announcement-msr --file about %}.

Briefly, I also led the cross-org science effort within Amazon to deliver bias mitigation solutions for the first family of Amazon's in-house multimodal foundation models, called Titan Multimodal Embeddings model and Amazon Titan Image Generation model, towards their re:Invent 2023 release {% cite kleindessner:2025:fairness_on_the_fly --file about %}{% cite barth:2023:amzn-titan-vision-announcement --file about %}{% cite ali:2023:fairness-eval --file about %}.

In 2020, I received the Doctoral Degree in Computer Science from the [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/), where I conducted my doctoral research at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home). During my PhD, I also interned at the [Amazon Research Lablet Tübingen](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazons-fourth-r-d-center-in-germany-is-dedicated-to-open-ai-research) for 2.5 months in the spring of 2019. Earlier, in 2015, I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science with honours from the [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/). Prior to that I worked as a Software Developer at ImmuneSecurity A/S (now [LogPoint](https://www.logpoint.com/en/)) between 2011 and 2013.
I studied Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/) in Nepal (2006-2010).
