a structural equation model (SEM) represents the data-generating process of each node \(X_j\) as a function \(f_j\) of its parents \(\mathrm{PA}_j\) in \(\mathcal{G}\), and <strong>unobserved</strong> noise \(N_j\), i.e.
\[X_j := f_j(\textrm{PA}_j, N_j),\]
where noise variables $N_1, \dotsc, N_n$ are statistically jointly independent. <span class="marginnote">A toy causal graph alongside its SEM. <img src="/images/sem.png" alt="Toy SCM" /></span> Each structural assignment represents the <i>causal mechanism</i> that generates child $X_j$ from its parents $\mathrm{PA}_j$. Here, we will explore two questions regarding unobserved noise variables:</p>
